# MetaLandSim
Metapopulations Persistence and Range Expansion Simulation
MetaLandSim is intended to provide a virtual environment, enabling the experimentation 
and simulation of processes at two scales: landscape and range. The simulation approach, 
taken by MetaLandSim, presents several advantages, like allowing the test of several 
alternatives and the knowledge of the full system. The role of simulation in landscape 
ecology is fundamental due to the spatial and temporal scale of the studied phenomena, 
which frequently hinders experimentation.
