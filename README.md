# MetaLandSim
Metapopulations Persistence and Range Expansion Simulation
MetaLandSim is intended to provide a virtual environment, enabling the experimentation 
and simulation of processes at two scales: landscape and range. The simulation approach, 
taken by MetaLandSim, presents several advantages, like allowing the test of several 
alternatives and the knowledge of the full system (Peck, 2004; Zurell et al. 2009). 
The role of simulation in landscape ecology is fundamental due to the spatial and temporal 
scale of the studied phenomena, which frequently hinders experimentation.
